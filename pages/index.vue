          Critter, once a quiet farmer in Critter's Backyard, was driven mad by the brutal slaughter of his family by marauding bandits. Now, he roams the wasteland, a ruthless force of vengeance. With a scarred face and eyes burning with fury, he wields a rusty machete and a shotgun, hunting those who wronged him. His name is whispered among survivors, a legend of madness and bloodshed. Will you dare enter Critter's Backyard and uncover the dark secrets fueling his unending quest for retribution?
